Hi, I’m Evan North, and I'm working on my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics.

I enjoy taking mathematical theory and producing working code that visualizes/validates the associated theory. The challenges associated with
practical implementation are what drive me forward on projects.

I work mostly in MatLab due to the nature of my research projects, but have historically used Python and C++ as well.
